# Roadmap

Status: protocol **Draft 0.5.0**; reference packages **0.9.3**.

## Now (done in this repo)

- [x] `.skill` container + digests
- [x] Mint + attestation (reference implementation)
- [x] Free local transparency-log registry
- [x] Reference runtime + CLI
- [x] Conformance tests
- [x] Docs, governance, CI
- [x] Local/offline agent provenance (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, custom)
- [x] Complete transferable `SkillContract`, assessment APIs, and JSON Schema
- [x] Structured contract-to-manifest/workflow compilation
- [x] Content-addressed `skill_id`; byte-identical repacking of the same source
- [x] RFC 8785 canonicalization pinned, with cross-implementation test vectors
      (`fixtures/canonicalization/`)
- [x] Adversarial package corpus (zip bombs, path tricks, hash mismatch,
      duplicate entries, tampered digests, stripped issuer_class) —
      `packages/cli/src/adversarial.test.ts`, run on every `npm test`
- [x] Structured permission grammar for `permission.hosts`/`.paths`
      (`@skillerr/protocol`'s `isValidHostPattern`/`isValidPathPattern`),
      validated at both contract-authoring and manifest-validation time
- [x] JSON Schemas (draft 2020-12) for every container file — contract,
      manifest, workflow, knowledge items, DSSE attestation — checked by
      `skill validate` via `@skillerr/protocol`'s `loadSchema()`
- [x] Production-grade signing: pluggable Ed25519 issuer signer + local
      trust store (`configured_ed25519`), replacing dev-HMAC-only trust —
      see [docs/KEY-CEREMONY.md](./KEY-CEREMONY.md)
- [x] Public RFC folder (`docs/rfcs/`) — six RFCs; PROTO-2 (asymmetric
      signing) has since shipped as real code, the rest remain spec-only
- [x] Forward `SKILL.md` -> `.skill` ingest (`skill ingest`), distinct from
      the existing lossy `to-skill-md` export — see
      [examples/ingest-skill-md/](../examples/ingest-skill-md/)
- [x] Native eval/benchmark loop (`skill eval`, sealed
      `provenance/benchmark.json`) — see [docs/EVAL.md](./EVAL.md)
- [x] `@skillerr/skill-score` wired in as an optional dependency of the CLI
      (`skill score`), mapping `provenance/benchmark.json` +
      manifest/provenance evidence into its assessment input, with a
      sealed `provenance/score.json` receipt slot. SKILL.md-ingested
      sources are honestly tiered self-reported, not observed — see
      `packages/cli/src/score-adapter.ts`
- [x] Bundled-script / progressive-disclosure semantics documented
      (`resources/scripts/*`, `resources/references/*`) — see
      [docs/RESOURCES.md](./RESOURCES.md). Found and fixed a real gap in
      the process: `exec`-class capabilities had no deny-by-default gate
      at all (unlike read/write/destructive/network)
- [x] Optional public transparency-log anchoring (`skill mint
      --transparency`, `skill verify-trust --online`), built on the
      official `@sigstore/*` client libraries against the public Rekor
      log (or a self-hosted one via `--rekor-url`) — see
      [docs/TRANSPARENCY.md](./TRANSPARENCY.md)

## Next (great contribution targets)

- [ ] Resolve `{{input_name}}` permission-path/host placeholders against
      the input's runtime value before matching in
      `assertCapabilityAllowed` — grammar-valid today (PROTO-5) but not yet
      functional; see the `scoped-npm-monorepo-publishing` gold example
- [ ] Validate the published authoring schema with an independent implementation
- [ ] Fulcio keyless mint (`skill mint --keyless`) — OIDC-bound identity
      instead of a pinned key; zero setup in CI (ambient GitHub Actions
      OIDC token, same as this repo's own `npm publish --provenance`),
      interactive browser login when run locally. See docs/TRANSPARENCY.md
- [ ] Public verify API + website utility (`GET /skill/{package_digest}`)
      — needs real hosting, not part of the static docs site
- [ ] Per-claim assurance model (`VerifiedClaims[]`) so no UI or agent can
      structurally present a self-reported field as verified — see the
      Launch Readiness plan's Phase E2
- [ ] Stronger `verify` assertion language + fixtures — would also enrich
      `skill score`'s validationEvidence beyond contains:/not_contains:/regex:
- [ ] Host adapters: local OpenAI-compatible, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex —
      also the natural place to implement real `tool`-step script execution
- [ ] First-class progressive-disclosure primitive (a manifest-level
      pointer list for `resources/references/*`, not just the naming
      convention documented in [RESOURCES.md](./RESOURCES.md))
- [ ] Pixel-level (not byte-level) drift check for the `brand` CI job —
      sharp/libvips PNG encoding isn't byte-stable across OS/architecture,
      so today's job only proves `scripts/build-brand.mjs` runs, not that
      checked-in assets exactly match its output
- [ ] Second language runtime (Go or Rust) for Stable eligibility — reproduce
      the adversarial corpus and canonicalization vectors byte-for-byte
      (now also covers Ed25519/PEM signing — see CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Later

- [ ] Multi-issuer trust roots / key transparency
- [ ] Optional ledger anchors as one permanence kind (never required)
- [ ] Mark **Candidate** then **Stable** after two independent runtimes pass the same corpus
